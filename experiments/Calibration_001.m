function code = Calibration_001
% Calibration_001   Code for the ViRMEn experiment Calibration_001.
%   code = Calibration_001   Returns handles to the functions that ViRMEn
%   executes during engine initialization, runtime and termination.

% --- INITIALIZATION code: executes before the ViRMEn engine starts.
function vr = initializationCodeFun(vr)



% --- RUNTIME code: executes on every iteration of the ViRMEn engine.
function vr = runtimeCodeFun(vr)



% --- TERMINATION code: executes after the ViRMEn engine stops.
function vr = terminationCodeFun(vr)
